These utilities consist principally of a bootstrapping system for connecting to a [Flint](https://github.com/VideoAmp/flint) Spark cluster from an [Ammonium](https://github.com/jupyter-scala/ammonium) shell or [Jupyter Scala](https://github.com/jupyter-scala/jupyter-scala) notebook.

## Usage

Assuming you have a Flint Spark master running at ip address `masterIP`, run

```scala
interp.load.ivy("com.videoamp" %% "ammonium-util" % "2.0.1")
vamp.ammonium.bootstrap(masterIP)
```

in a Jupyter Scala notebook to bind a `SparkConf` to the `sparkConf` variable in your notebook environment. After configuring Spark through `sparkConf`, you can access a bootstrapped and configured `SparkSession` with the `spark` notebook variable.
